<div class="threat1info">
   <p>Costal development can cause many serious problems to marine life which includes sea turtles fishes etc these kinds of problems mainly occur due to sewage influent, industrial discharge and  changes in water flow which could harmfully affect coral growth rates.
    Manual man-made events such as collecting large amount of sands from beaches which result in the formation of sand ditches that you should end up with unhealthy amount of water getting dragged back to the sea thus this results in changing of the pH of algae grown in the sea which mainly the sea turtles rely on when certain foods such as small fishes that are not found in the surrounding.

        <ul>
        <li>Decreased water quality which has a direct impact on the life capacity of sea turtles etc.</li>
        <li>Increased discharge pollution that limits the growth of marine life</li>
        <li>Soil erosion can cause a casssade of land events that remove vital nutrients in the soil for optimal egg hatching</li>
        <li>Baby sea turtles would have not have an inhabitable environment thus they would die before reaching the ocean</li>

       <p>These types of dangerous techniques such as harpooning or even wide area net catching can cause severe damage to a lot of sea turtles.
        Due to fishing practices in Sri Lanka the conservation status of sea turtles would drastically reduce within time thus this will also cause problems to entire eco systems in the ocean as well.</p>

         <p>The purposeful capture and death of these marine reptiles for a variety of reasons is referred to as “direct harvesting” of sea turtles. For their flesh, eggs, shells, and other body parts, sea turtles have been exploited throughout history, frequently as a result of cultural, traditional economic considerations.
          Direct harvesting has significantly reduced sea turtle populations around the world, putting several species in danger of becoming extinct in Sri-Lanka.</p>
