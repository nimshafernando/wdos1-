<div class="text">
<p>Four different species of sea turtles may be found in Sri Lanka, and they are all considered to be either endangered or critically endangered. The green turtle, hawksbill turtle , loggerhead turtle, and leatherback turtle are among these species. Several species can be found nesting on particular beaches all around the island, and each has its own distinctive traits.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The term hawksbill describes the small, pointed beak of a bird.</li>
          
          <li>They feature an odd arrangement of interlocking scales on their shells that give the edges a serrated appearance.</li>
          
          <li>Stores commonly labeled them as ‘’tortoises shell’’ due to their brightly colored and uniquely designed shells</li>
          
          <li> These turtles are mostly found in Kosgoda.</li>
          
          <li> These turtles also tend to migrate across to the colder regions of the sea when needed.</li>
          
          <li> Early December would be the peak time to witness this turtles across the sea bed.</li>

          <li>These turtles are the most prevalent species of sea turtles in Sri Lanka, which shells that are brown, black or dark green</li>

        <li>The green turtle, which may grow to a height of 120 centimeters from our faces out against the loggerhead turtle as the second largest species of turtle.</li>
        
        <li>Adult green turtles become vegetarian and eat only sea grasses, seaweed, and algae, whereas juvenile turtles eat worms, jellyfish, and sponges.</li>

      <div class="threats22">
        <ul>
          <li>The enormous heads of loggerhead turtles support strong jaw muscles that enable them to crush hard-shelled food like clams and sea urchins, thus the name of the species. </li> 
          
          <li>The only surviving members of a species of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are mostly the loggerhead turtles.</li>
          
          <li>Breeding happens all year round, although it is most active in the summer. With several partners females are able to produce two to five clutches of up to 130 eggs in a season.</li>
          
          <li>Since they are predominantly carnivores, loggerhead sea turtles may crush conchs, bivalves, and horseshoe crabs with their powerful teeth.</li>
      
          <li>These turtles are named for their broad ,muscular heads</li>
         
          <li>The locations in Sri Lanka where these types of turtles are found are mainly in Pigeon island national park.</li>

        <div class="threats">
          <ul>
          <li>The inky-blue carapace of the leatherback is slightly flexible and almost rubbery to the touch, in contrast to the hard, bony shells of all other sea turtles.</li>

          <li>Leatherbacks, who differ from their reptile ancestors in that they can create and store body heat, are able to sustain warm body temperatures in freezing water.</li>
          
          <li>These adaptations include a big body size, modifications to blood flow and swimming activity, and a thick covering of fat.</li>
          
          <li>There are records of leatherbacks diving 1,200 meters (4,000ft) or deeper. Scuba divers, on the other hand, usually only go down approximately 100 feet(30meters).</li>
          
          <li>Despite there aren’t many species that prey on adult leatherbacks, numerous animals, including as birds, raccoons and crabs, do prey on their eggs and young.</li>
          
          <li>The locations in Sri Lanka where these types of turtles are found are mainly in Panama beach.</li>
